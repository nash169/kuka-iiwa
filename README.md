# kuka_iiwa

Thi repository provides a ROS based interface to control KUKA's IIWA 7 and 14 through FRI (Fast Research Interface). The project is inspired by: https://github.com/IFL-CAMP/iiwa_stack. The FRI library is not provided in this code.

Althouth at the state of the art the interface is based on ROS1 I aim to move it to ROS2 as soon as possible.
